# react-firebase-chat

## Description
A Real-Time super chat web application. A super chat is a chat system that has only one chat room where everyone can see everyone's chat, similar to Twitch's chat.

## Features
  - Login system: There is a login system that is made possible by Firebase. The login system uses Firebase's google authentication meaning that you sign in with your google account.
  - Google's icon: Everyone is going to have their google icon display along with their chat
  - Real-time chatting, where you do not need to refresh the site to see new messages.
 
## How it's made

This is made using React as a front end, providing a real-time update and Firebase as a back-end, providing storing, fetching and authentication.


## What's the next step?

While the chatting system is working fantastic, My next vision is to create more "Rooms" Where people can play different games. An idea I came up with is a Pictionary game, where one person draws a picture (ideally it should update in real-time) and others try to guess what the person is drawing. While i don't know any specific technology that would allow me to implement this, I will find out, after all, it's how i start when i develope this app.
